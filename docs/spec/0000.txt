SPEC 0000               Specification Format                August 2018

1. Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   RFC2119 when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown
   here.

2. Character Encoding

   Plain-text files for specifications MUST use the CP437 standard with
   the exclusion of character code 0x0A which represents a line feed as
   specified in RFC20.

3. Line definition

   A line of text is a sequence of 0 or more characters followed by a
   line feed character. For the sake of and clarity, the ending line
   feed character is part of the line.

   Lines MUST NOT exceed 72 characters in length, including the ending
   line feed character. A line is called a blank line if it consists of
   only a line feed charachter.

3.1. Line numbering

   To ensure the following page dimension section is clear, we need to
   define how lines are numbered.

   Assuming a document is in digital format[1] and has a length of
   greater than 0 bytes, the first character in the document is part of
   line 0. Numbering lines from 0 instead of 1 gives us an advantage of
   clarity in the next section.

4. Pages

   A page is a sequence of 60 lines. That means for every line number
   n, the line is the start of a new page when n mod 60 = 0.

4.1 Page header

   The first line of a page SHOULD consist of a left-aligned spec
   number indicator, a centered (short) document title and a
   right-aligned publishing date (see 6.3). The second line of a page
   MUST always be blank, excluding the first page of the document.

4.2 Page footer

   The last line of a page MUST consist of a left-align last name of
   the author and a right-aligned page number between square brackets.
   The second-to-last line of a page must be blank, just like the
   second line of a page.

SPEC 0000               Specification Format                August 2018

5. Paragraphs

   A paragraph is a sequence of consecutive lines containing characters
   other than only a line feed. Paragraphs are separated by either a
   blank line or a page break. Paragraphs MUST NOT span multiple pages,
   limiting their size to 56 lines.

6. Document header

   The first lines of the first page of a specification document SHALL
   always contain left-aligned description headers (see 6.1) and
   right-aligned author identification and a right-aligned publishing
   date.

   After the initial lines (see 6.1 to 6.3), the document title is
   REQUIRED to be written on the first page of the document. For it's
   specification, see section 9.

   Further information on the first page should give a quick
   description of the contents of the document.

6.1. Descriptive header

   Each descriptive header is made up of a key and a value. Whitespace
   is not allowed in both the key and the value. Whitespace can only be
   included in the value by wrapping the value in quote characters.

   The key of the header consists of all characters of the line up to
   the first semicolon, excluding the semicolon itself and omitting all
   white-space characters.

   The value of the header starts at the first non-whitespace character
   after the first semicolon of the line. If the first character is a
   quote, the value ends at the next quote in the line. If the first
   character is not a quote, the value ends at the next whitespace
   character.

6.2. Short author identification

   In order to allow authors to take some credit and to track who has
   written what, the author's name MUST be added right-aligned on the
   first line of the first page of the document. To prevent mixing
   notations between documents, the names SHOULD be written as only the
   first letters of all given names in capitals, separated by dots, a
   space and the Family name starting with a capital. When written by a
   group with a name, the short author identification string SHOULD
   state the group's name.

6.3. Publish date

   Because a document is unlikely to have been written within a day, a
   publish date is simply the month's name starting with a capital
   followed by the year, both following the Gregorian calendar.

SPEC 0000               Specification Format                August 2018

7. Document footer

   The document SHOULD close, starting on a new page, with all
   informative resources which were used to write the document, noting
   their keyword and document title. When possible, a URL to the
   resource SHOULD be included.

   After the informative resources, the document SHOULD end with one
   or several pages dedicated to the information of the author(s) and
   if possible their contact information.

8. Section titles

   Section titles SHOULD be a short text about the subject the section
   describes. Whether it is simply the keyword of what it explains, a
   problem statement or other type of text is up to the author as long
   as it's relevant to the section's body.

   A section title MUST start with a capital character & MUST NOT
   contain any other capital letters, excluding where they are required
   in names or abbreviations.

9. Document title

   The title of the document should clearly state the main subject of
   the document and it's contents. Each word of the document title must
   start with a capital character when noted as the title of the
   document.

   On the first page of the document, the title should be centered
   horizontally and have at least 2 blank lines both above and below
   it. The document title SHOULD be as close to the document's
   descriptive headers.
