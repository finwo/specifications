1. Introduction

   The ultimate goal of the Specification publication process is to produce
   documents that are readable, clear, consistent, and reasonably uniform.  The
   basic formatting conventions for Specifications were established in August
   2018.  This document describes the fundamental and unique style conventions
   and editorial policies currently in use for the Specification Series.  It is
   intended as a stable, infrequently updated reference for authors, editors,
   and reviewers.

   The world of technical publishing has generally accepted rules for grammar,
   punctuation, capitalization, sentence length and complexity, parallelism,
   etc.

   All Specifications begin as Drafts, and a well-written and properly
   constructed Draft provides a strong basis for a good Specification.

2. Key Words

   In many standards track documents several words are used to signify the
   requirements in the specification.  These words are often capitalized. This
   document defines these words as they should be interpreted in Specification
   Documents.  Authors who follow these guidelines should incorporate this
   phrase near the beginning of their document:

      The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
      document are to be interpreted as described in SPEC0003.

   Note that the force of these words is modified by the requirement level of
   the document in which they are used.

2.1. MUST

   This word, or the terms "REQUIRED" and "SHALL", mean that the definition is
   an absolute requirement of the specification.

2.2. MUST NOT

   This phrase, or the phrase "SHALL NOT", mean that the definition is an
   absolute prohibition of the specification.

2.3. SHOULD

   This word, or the adjective "RECOMMENDED", mean that there may exist valid
   reasons in particular circumstances to ignore a particular item, but the full
   implications must be understood and carefully weighed before choosing a
   different course.

2.4. SHOULD NOT

   This phrase, or the phrase "NOT RECOMMENDED" mean that there may exist
   valid reasons in particular circumstances when the particular behavior is
   acceptable or even useful, but the full implications should be understood
   and the case carefully weighed before implementing any behavior described
   with this label.

2.5. MAY

   This word, or the adjective "OPTIONAL", mean that an item is truly
   optional.  One vendor may choose to include the item because a particular
   marketplace requires it or because the vendor feels that it enhances the
   product while another vendor may omit the same item.  An implementation
   which does not include a particular option MUST be prepared to interoperate
   with another implementationn which does include the option, though perhaps
   with reduced functionality.  In the same vein an implementation which does
   include a particular option MUST be prepared to interoperate with another
   implementation which does not include the option (except, of course, for the
   feature the option provides).

2.6. Guidance in the use of these Imperatives

   Imperatives of the type defined in this section must be used with care and
   sparingly.  In particular, they MUST only be used where it is actually
   required for interoperation or to limit behavior which has potential for
   causing harm (e.g., limiting retransmissions).  For example, they must not
   be used to try to impose a particular method on implementors where the
   method is not required for interoperability.

2.7. Security Considerations

   These terms are frequently used to specify behavior with security
   implications.  The effects on security of not implementing a MUST or SHOULD,
   or doing something the specification says MUST NOT or SHOULD NOT be done
   may be very subtle.  Document authors should take the time to elaborate the
   security implementations of not following recommendations or requirements
   as most implementors will not have had the benefit of the experience and
   discussions that produced the specification.

3. Specification Style Conventions

   This Style Guide does not use the terminology as defined in section 2.

3.1. Language

   The Specification publication language is English.  Spelling may be either
   American or British, as long as an individual document is internally
   consistent.  Where both American and British English spelling are used within
   a document or cluster of documents, the text will have to be modified to be
   consistent with American English spelling.

3.2. Punctuation

   - No overstriking (or underlining) is allowed.

   - When a sentence ended by a period is immediately followed by another
     sentence, there must be two blank spaces after the period.

  - A comma is used before the last item of a series, e.g.,

       "TCP service is reliable, ordered, and full duplex"

  - When quoting literal text, punctuation is placed outside quotation marks,
    e.g.,

       Search for the string "Error Found".

    When quoting general text, such as general text from another Specification,
    punctuation may be included within the quotation marks.

    Quotation marks are not necessary when text is formatted as a block
    quotation.

3.3. DNS Names and URIs

   Angle brackets are strongly recommended around URIs, e.g.,

      <http://example.org/>

3.4. Capitalization

   - Capitalizationn must be consistent within the document and ideally should
     be consistent with related specifications.  Refer to the online table of
     decisions on consistent usage of terms in Specifications.

   - Per CMOS guidelines, the major words in Specification titles and section
     titles should be capitalized (this is sometimes called "title cases").
     Typically, all words in a title will be capitalized, except for internal
     articles, prepositions, and conjunctions.

   - Section titles that are in sentence form will follow typical sentence
     capitalization.

   - Titles of figures may be in sentence form or use title case.

3.5. Citations

   - References and citations must match.  That is, there must be a reference
     for each citation used. and vice versa.

   - Citations must be enclosed in square brackets (e.g., "[CITE1]").

   - A citation/reference tag must not contain spaces.

        Example: "[SPEC0003]" rather than "[SPEC 0003]"

     However, the proper textual naming of a Specification contains a space.

        Example: "See SPEC 0003 for more information."

   - Cross-references within the body of the document and to other documents
     must use section numbers rather than page numbers, as pagination may change
     per format and device.

3.6. Abbreviation Rules

   Abbreviations should be expanded in document titles and upon first use in the
   document.  The full expansion of the text should be followed by the
   abbreviation itself in parenthesis.  The exception is an abbreviation that is
   so common that the readership of Specifications can be expected to recognize
   it immediately; examples include (but are not limited to) TCP, IP, SNMP, and
   HTTP.  Some cases are marginal, and the author should make the final
   judgement, weighing obscurity agains complexity.

4. Structure of a Specification

   A published Specification will largely contain the elements in the following
   list.  Some of these sections are required, as noted.  Sections are allowed
   to contain nothing but subsections.  The rules for each of these elements are
   described in more details below.

      First-page header                        [Required]
      Title                                    [Required]
      Abstract                                 [Required]
      Copyright Notice                         [Required]
      Table of Contents                        [Required]
      Body of the Memo                         [Required]
        1. Introductionn                       [Required]
        2. Requirements Language
        3. ...
           MAIN BODY OF THE TEXT
        6. ...
        7. Internationalization Considerations
        8. Security Considerations             [Required]
        9. References
        9.1. Normative References
        9.2. Informative References
      Acknowledgements
      Contributors
      Author's Information                     [Required]

   Within the body of the document, the order shown above is strongly
   recommended.  Exceptions may be questioned.  Outside the body of the
   document, the order above is required.  The section numbers above are for
   illustrative purposes; they are not intended to correspond to required
   numbering in a Specification.

4.1. First-Page header

   Headers will follow the format described in "RFC Streams, Headers, and
   Boilerplates" [RFC5741] and it's successors.  In addition, the following
   conventions will apply.

4.1.1. Author/Editor

   The determination of who should be listed as an author or editor on a
   Specification is made by the stream.

   The author's name (initial followed by family name) appears on the first line
   of the heading.  Some variation, such as additional initials or
   capitalization of family name, is acceptable.  Once the author has selected
   how their name should appear, they should use that display consistently in
   all of their documents.

   The total number of authors or editors on the first page is generally limited
   to five individuals and their affiliations.  If there is a request for more
   than five authors, the stream-approving body needs to considor if one or two
   editors should have primary responsibility for this document, with the other
   individuals listed in the Contributors or Acknowledgements section.  There
   must be a direct correlation of authors and editors in the document header
   and the Authors' Information section.  These are the individuals that must
   sign off on the document and respond to inquiries.

4.1.2. Organization

   The author's organization is indicated on the line following the author's
   name.

   For multiple authors, each author name appears on its own line, followed by
   that author's organization.  When more than one author is affiliated with the
   same organization, the organization can be "factored out", appearing only
   once following the corresponding Author lines.  However, such factoring is
   inappropriate when it would force an unacceptable reordering of author names.

   If an author can not or will not provide an affiliation for any reason,
   "Independent", "Individual Contributor", "Retired", or some other term that
   appropriately describes the author's affiliation may be used. Alternatively,
   a blank line may be included in the document header where no affiliation is
   provided.

4.1.3. Updates and Obsoletes

   When a Specification obsoletes or updates a previously published
   Specification or Specifications, this information is included in the document
   header.  For example:

      "Updates: nnnn" or "Updates: nnnn, ..., nnnn"

      "Obsoletes: nnnn" or "Obsoletes: nnnn, ..., nnnn"

   If the document updates or obsoletes more than one document, numbers will be
   listed in ascending order.

4.2. Full Title

   The title must be centered below the rest of the heading, preceded by two
   blank lines and followed by one blank line.

   Choosing a good title for a Specification can be a challenge. A good title
   should fairly represent the scope and purpose of the document without being
   either too general or too specific and lengthy.

   Abbreviations in a title must generally be expanded when first encountered
   (See section 3.6 for additional guidance on abbreviations).

   It is often helpful to follow the expansion with the parenthesized
   abbreviation, as in the following example:

                      Encoding Rules for the
      Common Routing Encapsulation Extension Protocol (CREEP)

4.3. Abstract Section

   Every Specificationn must have an Abstract that provides a concise and
   comprehensive overview of the purpose and contents of the entire document, to
   give a technically knowledgeable reader a general overview of the function of
   the document.

   Composing a useful Abstract generally requires thought and care. Usually, an
   Abstract should begin with a phrase like "This memo ..." or "This document
   ...". A satisfactory Abstract can often be constructed in part from material
   within the Introduction section, but an effective Abstract may be shorter,
   less detailed, and perhaps broader in scope than the Introduction.  Simply
   copying and pasting the first few paragraphs of the Introduction is allowed,
   but it may result in an Abstract that is both incomplete and redundant.  Note
   also that an Abstract is not a subsitute for an Introduction; the
   Specification should be self-contained as if there were no Abstract.

   Similarly, the Abstract should be complete in itself.  It will appear is
   isolation in publication announcements.  Therefore, the Abstract must not
   contain citations.

4.4. Table of Contents Section

   A Table of Contents (TOC) is required in all Specifications. It must be
   positioned after the Copyright Notice and before the Introduction.

4.5. Body of the Specification

   Following the TOC is the body of the document.

   Each Specification must include an Introduction section that (among other
   things) explains the motivation for the Specification and (if appropriate)
   describes the applicability of the document, e.g., whether it specifies a
   protocol, provides a discussion of some problem, is simply of interest to the
   Internet community, or provides a status report on some activity.  Thebody of
   the document and the Abstract must be self-contained and separable.  This may
   result in some duplication of text between the Abstract and the Introduction;
   this is acceptable.

4.5.1. Introduction Section

   The Introduction section should always be the first section following the
   TOC.  While "Introduction" is recommended, authors may choose alternate
   titles such as "Overview" or "Background".  These alternates are acceptable.

4.5.2. Requirements Language Section
      4.5.3. Internationalization Considerations Section
      4.5.4. Security Considerations Section
      4.5.5. References Section
         4.5.5.1. URIs in Specifications
         4.5.5.2. Referencing Specifications
         4.5.5.3. Referencing Other Standards Development Organizations
   4.6. Appendices Section
   4.7. Acknowledgements Section
   4.8. Contributors Section
   4.9. Author's Information Section
