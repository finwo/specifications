# TrackThis Code Style Guides

Most open-source projects have their own common code style, whether documented
or not. A style guide is a set of (sometimes arbitary) conventions about how to
write code for those projects. It is much easier to understand a large codebase
when all the code in it is in a consistent style.

"Style" covers a lot of ground, from "use camelCase for variable names" to
"never use global variables" to "never use exceptions." This project
([trackthis/styleguide](https://github.com/trackthis/styleguide)) links to the
style guidelines we use for TrackThis code. If you are modifying a project that
is to be included in, or originated at, TrackThis, you may be pointed to this
page to see the style guides that apply to that project.

This project aims to cover all grounds of the languages used within trackthis
and to provide tools to enforce the guide. A list of languages included in this
guide can be found below.
