SPEC 0000               Specification format                August 2018

1. Character Encoding

   Plain-text files for specifications must use the IBM Code page 437
   with the exclusion of character code 0x0A which represents a
   line feed as specified in IETF-RFC20.

2. Line definition

   A line of text is a sequence of 0 or more characters followed by a
   line feed character. For the sake of and clarity, the ending line
   feed character is part of the line.

   Lines are not allowed to be longer than 72 characters, including the
   ending line feed character. A line is called a blank line if it
   consists of only a line feed charachter.

2.1. Line numbering

   To ensure the following page dimension section is clear, we need to
   define how lines are numbered.

   Assuming a document is in digital format[1] and has a length of
   greater than 0 bytes, the first character in the document is part of
   line 0. Numbering lines from 0 instead of 1 gives us an advantage of
   clarity in the next section.

3. Pages

   A page is a sequence of 58 lines. That means for every line number
   n, the line is the start of a new page when n mod 58 = 0.

3.1 Page header

   The first line of a page must consist of a left-aligned spec number
   indicator, a centered (short) document title and a right-aligned
   month indicator. The second line of a page must always be blank.

3.2 Page footer

   The last line of a page must consist of a left-align last name of
   the author and a right-aligned page number between square brackets.
   The second-to-last line of a page must be blank, just like the
   second line of a page.

4. Paragraphs

   A paragraph is a sequence of consecutive lines containing characters
   other than only a line feed. Paragraphs are separated by either a
   blank line or a page break. Paragraphs are not allowed to span
   multiple pages, limiting their size to 54 lines.

5. Document header

   The first lines of the first page of a specification document shall
   always contain left-aligned headers (see 5.1) and right-aligned
   identification and a right-aligned date.
