SPEC 0000            Specification requirements             August 2018

1. Character Encoding

   Plain-text files for specifications must use the IBM Code page 437
   with the exclusion of character code 0x0A which represents a
   line feed as specified in IETF-RFC20.

2. Line definition

   A line of text is a sequence of 0 or more characters followed by a
   line feed character. For the sake of and clarity, the ending line
   feed character is part of the line.

   Lines are not allowed to be longer than 72 characters, excluding the
   ending line feed.

3. Line numbering

   To ensure the following page dimension section is clear, we need to
   define how lines are numbered.

   Assuming a document is in digital format[1] and has a length of
   greater than 0 bytes, the first character in the document is part of
   line 0. Numbering lines from 0 instead of 1 gives us an advantage of
   clarity in the next section.

4. Page dimensions

   The size of a page is fixed at 58 lines. That means for every line
   number n, the line is the start of a new page when n mod 58 = 0.
